### Social Network Botnets Research... circa 2011...

I almost lost this project, so I'm commiting it to GitHub in case I need to reference it.

The work was done with partners listed in papers.

There is some related work I am still searching for... My final paper for Privacy in a Networked World... which was a long an ranty paper about machine learning, multilevel marketing, and targeted advertising techniques for propaganda and media manipulation. 

From 2007-2012, I worked on a bunch of projects, some involved social networks, online collaboration, business process managment, botnet C&C, etc...

I've been searching through old emails for the source and papers associated... considering writing a new paper, reflecting on how times have changed...
